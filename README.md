I am an AI system engineer at Verhaert, working on research and development of intelligent systems :mechanical_arm: 

This profile has evolved from a place to put my student projects to a playground for all kinds of stuff. I'm currently working on my Jetson AI Specialist certification, for which I plan to add a new webpage in the near future.
In the meantime you can check out some of my previous projects [here](https://verleysenniels.github.io/)
